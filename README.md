## Setup Guide (Localhost)

This guide covers setting up your server on your own hardware and only supports devices running up-to-date versions of Windows/macOS/Linux.

You'll first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It doesn't matter if you pick the LTS or Latest version, they'll both work fine.

Once `Node.js` is installed, [download the source code of the latest release of Open Source Arras](https://github.com/AE0hello/open-source-arras/releases) and extract it. Open the extracted folder in a terminal and run the following commands in order:
1. `npm i` (this installs necessary dependencies)
2. `npm run start` (this actually starts the server)

If there aren't any errors, your server will start up. Go to `localhost:3000` in your favourite web browser (keep the terminal window open, closing it will shut down the server) to play.

After the first install, you may use either `run.bat` (if you're on Windows) or `run.sh` (if you're not) to quickly launch the server without opening the terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to stay up to date, create a fork, download a git client (such as GitHub Desktop), and sync the fork whenever there's a major update.
> 
> **Major updates may introduce breaking changes that alter how certain things work. It is *your responsibility* to keep your private server up-to-date and functioning.**

## Server setup
You can set up in-game servers in config.js file, in `servers`. For further explanation, see the setting itself. It's an array of objects where each object is a server.

### Travelling between servers (Nexus)
Copy this code into your server's `properties`:
```
server_travel_properties: {
    loop_interval: 10000, // how often the portal loop executes in seconds
    portals: 1, // amount of portals to spawn
},
server_travel: [
    {
        ip: '<YourIP>', // destination server host, don't add "https://" or any slashes to it
        portal_properties: {
            spawn_chance: 3, // chance for a portal to spawn somewhere in the map each loop iteration (higher = lower chances, lower = higher chance)
            color: 'red', // portal color
        }
    }
]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to set `allow_server_travel` to true in your destination server's `properties`.
